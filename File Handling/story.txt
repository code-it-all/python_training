Once upon a time, in a quiet little village, there was a curious cat named Whiskers.
Whiskers loved exploring, but more than anything, Whiskers loved stories.
Every evening, she would sit by the fireplace while her owner, an old storyteller, shared tales of great heroes and magical adventures.

One night, as the storyteller began, a mysterious gust of wind blew through the room, scattering all the pages of his book.
Whiskers, quick as ever, pounced and gathered the pages.
When the old man smiled and thanked her, Whiskers purred softly, feeling proud.

From that day on, Whiskers became the village’s storekeeper.
She collected tales from far and wide, ensuring that every word was safely stored.
Her favorite was the word "magic"—because every story carried a spark of magic within it.

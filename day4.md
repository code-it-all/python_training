## Variable, Statements and Expression

### 2.2 Value and Data Types
1. _Value in Python:_
- A value is one of the basic things a program works with, like a letter or a number. 
You can print values in Python.
-  ```python
    print(101)
    print("Hello World")
     ```
   
2. _Data Types:_
- Numeric : int, float, complex
- Sequence Type : string, list, tuple
- Mapping Type : dict
- Boolean : bool
- Set Type : set, frozenset
- Binary Types : bytes, bytearray, memoryview

_If you are not sure what type a value has, use the type function to find out._
```python
    print(type(20))   #int
    print(type("Hello world!"))   #str
    print(type(3.14))   #float
```
### 2.3 Operators and Operands

**Operators**: Operators are special symbols that perform operations on variables and values.

1. **Arithmetic operators**: 
-  Arithmetic operators are symbols used to perform mathematical operations on numerical values.
-  Arithmetic operators include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%).

2.  **Comparision Operators**:
- Comparison operators compare two values/variables and return a boolean result: True or False. 
-  The comparison operators also called relational operators. 
- Some of the well known operators are "<" stands for less than, and ">" stands for greater than operator.
- ```python
    <	Less than	                a<b
    >	Greater than	                a>b
    <=	Less than or equal to	        a<=b
    >=	Greater than or equal to	a>=b
    ==	Is equal to	                a==b
    !=	Is not equal to	                a!=b
```
